# Hello ðŸŒ™ 

Currently graduate gamde design & devlopment student at RIT. 

Doing:
- Crafting an [interpreter](https://github.com/KHN190/rlox), as well as coding using Rust.
- A design course, an AI course and a software management course. I recently fell in love with psychoanalysis readings that was accidently brought into my design course.

Public stuffs I made:
- Some comopute shaders in Unity, see my pinned projects.
- A procedural generated [puzzle game](https://github.com/KHN190/Mondrian) for GMTK
- A [3D hex map editor / generator](https://github.com/KHN190/HexMapEditor) in Unity. Intend to provide a framework for hexagon games.

Plans:
- A turn based framework can undo / redo and support RTS mode.
- Use game mechanics to form a narrative, e.g. tell a story using physics simulation.
